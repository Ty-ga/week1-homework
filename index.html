                    <p>Standards-based website design and why is it important? There is a governing body of organizations (w3c) that define what the website standards are for all website design companies.                    
                    In turn, these standards are important to website design companies and website owners because following these standards helps to assure cross-platform and cross-browser compatibility. Another important reason to follow website standards is to gain a competitive advantage in search engine optimization. At Ty Canniffe Website Design I adhere to these standards by hand writing code and validating my code to ensure maximum compliance</p>
